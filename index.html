                <h4>Eric's New Hat</h4>
              <p>
                Eric came in through the back kitchen entrance sporting a fresh addition to his cook’s uniform: a just-purchased secondhand chef’s hat. Acquired at a nearby thrift store, it was one of the erect, starched-linen types with long vertical folds. Well used it no longer had the crisp white appearance of a new hat, but rather a faded and creamy yellow-beige hue. In squared black all caps letters the front of the hat's wide elastic band bore the phrase "KISS THE COOK"; an inescapable message to any who may chance upon facing the hat's occupant.
              </p>
              <p>
                As he prepared for dinner service, Eric appeared both amused and pleased by his new acquisition. And he confided to his line-cook brethren, myself included, that he was looking forward to test the effectiveness of the hat’s invitation on a certain waitress whose undeniable beauty had always garnered his appreciation.
              </p>
              <p>
                At some point during the afternoon, I took a glance at Eric’s hat, with its unambiguous message, and was struck by an idea. Then shortly before the arrival of the dinner servers, I put my idea in action by plucking a single hair from my head and snipping off a small section of beige-colored labeling tape. With the hair concealed in my palm and tape hidden between my thumb and forefinger I then approached Eric. 
              </p>
              <p>
                “It’s a great hat Eric,”  I said. “but there’s a hair stuck right on the front of it.”
                I then brought my cupped hand up to his hat and lightly tapped in the piece of tape. Lowering my hand I then showed him the hair,  easily passing for one of his own, before letting it fall to the ground. 
              </p>
              <p>
                “Thanks,” he said, “If that wound up on a plate it could have traumatized someone.  Maybe even cost me my job”
              </p>
              <p>
                “Very true,” I replied, chuckling at the hyperbole. Then stepped back to review my work. Yes indeed, at only a short distance the masking tape was virtually invisible. And though  impairing the lettering's evenness a bit, was a near perfect match to the hat’s time-worn aspect.
              </p>
              <p>
                The night servers then began to enter the  the dining room, which was separated from the kitchen by a couple of swinging saloon doors. Soon each would be coming into the kitchen and interacting with the cooks as part of their work routine. I noticed a slightly stifled grin spread on Eric’s face as the voice of a certain undeniably beautiful sever was heard approaching the saloon doors. And as he prepared for the surprised giggle, and perhaps even a peck on the cheek, in response to KISS THE COOK; I braced myself for the very different, indeed wholly unpredictable response to:

                Of himself, Musician Richard Strauss was reported to have said: “I may not be a first-rate composer, but I am a first-class second-rate composer."
              </p>
              <p>
                Substitute chef for composer and this aptly describes myself. In two circumstances I have had the title "chef". I have owned two restaurants at which I was the principle cook, thus chef by default. I have worked in many fine restaurants learning under many fine chefs. And I am indeed capable of making a very good plate of food.
              </p>
              <p>
                But personally I could not care less for the title, nor have ever sought the position. Cooking became a vocation  more out of immediate opportunity than any career-oriented forethought or passion for the craft. Learning to cook well has certainly been a benefit to myself, to those for whom I have cooked, and those for whom I have worked. But I have very seldom spent non-working hours studying different culinary techniques, and devising ways to produce ever-improved food concepts, as first-rate chefs invariably do.

                And though my cooking/hospality experience (I've done it all) certainly has not made me rich, nor my future secure, it has introduced me to many interesting places, circumstances, and people. And, embelleshed with a few preferred recipes, that’s what this modest work is about: written snapshots - literary small plates - of a first-class second-rate chef.

              <p>I took my first restaurant job at the age of 15. It was   at a hole-in-the-wall place   called Le Provencal in downtown Kirkland,     Washington - a city now run amok with tech geeks, stupid high housing and pretention.   From the outside Le Provencal was a plain,      ground-level rectangle with   a charcoal awning and an alley to the left that led     back to the small, dingy kitchen. Inside the front of the house was nice, though. Two candle lit rooms, one for regular dining the other for private parties. Dark wood furniture, wine-colored carpeting; part rustic, part elegance.
              </p>
              <p>The owner, Philipe, was French and spoke with a heavy french accent. The waiters were French, and spoke with heavy french       accents. There were two chefs. One a 20 something sadistic hothead named Larry. The other a chubby Mexican called Rios.           Another cook, the “salad boy,” was Dave Jepeski. A blonde, lanky guy with a       jacked up Nova who was always flapping off.
               </p>
               <p>
                 The plate washers were a couple of snooty high school senior babes. They worked a small, circular commercial dishwasher, and performed menial prep tasks like peeling garlic and potatoes.  
              </p>
              <p>
                My office was the pot and pan sink, to the immediate right of the chefs, the hot flat top, and gas burners. My tools of the trade water, soap and scrubbers. No machine.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was not a good kid at that stage of my life. A liar, thief, bad student, worse son. And I did drugs. Lots of ‘em.  But somehow I managed to make it through the job’s first month or so without getting the axe. Even though I usually showed up with a dope-addled brain. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I was on call one afternoon, hanging out with a friend who had managed to score some peyote, a yet untried experience. I had been on call a couple times before, and they never needed me. I figured they wouldn’t this night either. So going along with my friend I scraped the mildewy fuzz off some of the buttons and popped ‘em.
              </p>
              <p>
                A little while later I called the restaurant. The owner answered and told me to come in. It was gonna be a busy night.

                <p>Salt and pepper each side of thighs. In an oiled nonstick saucepan, cook skin side down over medium low heat until golden and   crispy. Remove from pan and reserve.
                Pour out chicken fat from the saucepan, and reserve for other uses if desired.
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>Place saucepan in preheated oven, making sure the liquid inside comes up to the skin but does not submerge it. Braise 45 minutes, periodically checking that a low simmer is maintained, and that the liquid stays at the lower level of the skin. If it falls below, nuke a little water or chicken stock and replenish. The result should be fork tender flesh with contrasting light, crispy skin. 
                When chicken is finished set aside, place sauce on low heat and stir in a couple tablespoons butter. Ladle sauce on plates and place chicken on top, skin side up. Goes well with spuds, rice, pasta, polenta, etc. Garnish with parmesan, fresh basil, flavorful olives or aioli if desired. A dry ros&egrave; or medium bodied red should pair nicely.

                 <h4>Button Button 2</h4>
               <p> It was a two mile walk to the restaurant, and I cursed the whole way. I hated the place, hated the work. And resented the idea of a good high interrupted. But after doing my first tasks, vacuuming the front and setting up the pot and pan area, my mind was still clear. Bad peyote, I guess. Or not peyote at all. Really didn't know.</p>
               <p> Before dinner service staff was allowed to eat and goof off a bit before resuming work. After finishing a plate of Daube, a sort of french beef stew, I stepped outside with Jepeski. He pulled out a bag with some Colombian Gold in it and stuffed some in a pipe. I told him I popped some peyote buttons earlier but nothing was happening. He lit the pipe, inhaled, and offered it to me.</p> 
               <p>“Now something will happen," he said. We smoked the bowl and went back in. It was good weed. I was nice and stoned and started slogging through my work.</p> 
               <p>So how you doin’ kid,” Rios asked, knowing, as all  kitchen staff and probably waiters too, that me and Jepeski were lit. So what. A little buzz. I could still work.
               </p>
               <p>“I’m doing just...”
               The peyote kicked in.
               “Whaa...?”<br/>
               “Yeah, I know kid. Tough question. Just try an' keep up. We gonna need stuff ASAP.”</p>
               <p>Don’t know why - probably shouldn’t have - but I drifted over to Jepeski and told him: “The peyote kicked in.” He looked at my face, into my eyes. “Wow, dude. You’re <em>seriously</em> baked. Got any more?”
               </p>
               <p>I was seriously baked. 
               And within a few minutes all staff knew I was seriously baked. Flapping Jepeski.</p>
               <p>Much of what followed I can't recall, but some of the night's hilarity remains: Repeated barks of "HOT!" just as Larry sent red-glowing pans crashing into the sink scalding my hands and arms; freakish smells of burnt butter, frog legs, sauce veloute and pink detergent relentlessly wafting up my nostrils; tons of charred, greasy metal needing attention "ASAP!"; giggling senior babes mocking me; french-gibbering waiters peering into my wasted eyes, pleading for <em>le peyot&egrave;</em>.... 
               </p>
               <p> But I made it. Didn't get canned or even told not to get so baked at work. Just how the placed rolled. Afterwards Probably smoked a couple more bowls with Jepeski in his jacked up Nova.</p>

               <h4>Nancy</h4>
               <p>It was a sunny late summer afternoon. Except for the lone woman seated at a table with a fine veiw of Lake Washington, the restaurant was empty. Observing her from the the opposite end of the dining room, the young server was struck by her apparent beauty. And by how much she reminded him of Nancy. For most of the previous year Nancy and he had been together, as happy as any two could hope to be.</p>
               <p>Prior to his time with Nancy, nearly all of his teen  years had been a tragedy of drugs, lying and thievery. But during those wasted years he yet managed to keep his french restaurant job, advancing from dishwasher to pantry cook. And it was there, shortly after she became employed as a hostess, where they met and began a relationship. And as their intimacy solidified her wholesomeness helped to change his self-destructive path. Hence his mind was now clear, his days fruitful, and his future bright. But since only a short time had elapsed since Nancy had been compelled to relocate to Alaska, his thoughts were distracted, his heart heavy.</p>
               <p>Filled water goblet in hand he approached the solitary customer. The nearer proximity revealed traits differing from Nancy, but also confirmed his initial impression: she was indeed beautiful. The shoulder-length of her hair was about the same as Nancy's and cast a similar golden sheen, but was styled with shorter, more defined waves. Her eyes a purer, darker blue than the grey-blue eyes of Nancy. The contour of her face was, like Nancy's, a pleasing elongated oval, but with a touch more prominence to her cheeks and chin. And though still posessing a vibrant youthful bloom, she was clearly older than Nancy, perhaps by six or seven years, he thought.</p>
               <p>"Good afternoon," he said, placing the goblet on the table. "How are you?"</p> <p>Turning her attention from the gem-sparkling view, she looked at directly at him. And after a moment's pause smiled warmly and responded:</p>
               <p>"I'm fine, thank you. How are you?"</p>                   <p>"I'm fine," he said, slightly unnerved by the undisguised affection that her steady gaze communicated. Following another brief pause and still in the magic of her warm, lovely gaze, he focused back on the job at hand:</p>
               <p>" Would you care for anything else at this time?"</p>
               <p>"No. Water will be fine until my friends arrive."</p>
               <p>The thought of her friends' arrival seeming to divert her attention from the server, she resumed looking out the window towards the lake. But as he turned to depart, she looked to him once more.</p>
               <p>"Thank you," she said. "You're very sweet."</p>

               <p>Adjust to desired thickness by adding more liquid or mayo/mustard. Experiment by adding any number of ingredients such as chopped garlic, fresh or dried herbs, vinegar, parmesan, etc.</p> 
               <p>For a nice on the fly Caesar dressing start with a fairly thick brine/mustard/mayo base. Add Worcestershire, finely chopped garlic, fresh lemon juice, balsamic vinegar, fresh cracked black pepper, a dash of extra virgin olive oil, and a bit of tabasco.</p>

                <p>Turning to face her he again noted the genuine warmth and affection of her gaze as she held his eyes.</p>
                <p>His equilibrium suddenly shattered, he was yet able to mumble a shy "thanks" before she returned her attention to the lake.</p>
                <p>From the moment he met Nancy and indeed throughout their relationship, her presence invariably had a mellowing effect on his emotions. This was not a result of blunted interest or want of excitement, but rather a manifestation of profound compatability. Similarly attuned to life and its vagaries they were, by extention, naturally attuned to each other. They were close in age and monetary status, enjoyed the same activities and pleasantries, alike in temprament, and physically and mentally complimentary. They were content together during idleness, play, passion or silence. With Nancy he was always at ease.</p>
                <p>It was a perfect contrast to how he now felt. And walking the length of the dining room to the waiter's station, the young server wasn't sure if he could complete the journey without toppling over. His heart raced, his limbs trembled, and his suddenly untethered mind reeled in a delerium of unexperienced intoxication. He knew nothing of this golden haired beauty, but her unabashed affection and simple compliment filled him with an intense blast of confusion and joy.</p>
                <p>Entering the wait station, young server began distractedly organizing for evening service when the head waiter arrived. Tall, charismatic, and a decade his senior, the head waiter was more than a little intimidating to the younger man, who typically was hesitant to initiate any conversation not related to the job. At this time, however, he needed to vent some of the emotional electricity surging through his nerves. Hence overcoming his accustomed timidity, he  paused briefly to compose his unsettled thoughts and spoke:
                </p>
                <p>"There's uh, uh, a lady out there. Table 10. Very beautiful. Um, seems to like me."</p>
                <p>Moving to the doorless arch separating the wait station from the dining area, the head waiter peered in the direction of the lone customer. Then with an expression of incredulity looked back to his  associate.</p>

                <p>"You don't know who that is?" he asked.</p>
                <p>"No."</p>
                <p>"That's Nancy."</p>
                <p><em>"Nancy?</em> Well that's a...."</p>
                <p>"Nancy Wilson"</p>
                <p>"Oh. Nancy Wilson?"</p>
                <p>"Man you can't be that sheltered. You never heard Magic Man....Crazy On You....Never heard of Heart?"</p>
                <p>"<em>Ahh.</em> Well yes. Sure I have. But she, she was really nice....Said I was...."</p>
                <p>"Yeah, well she is really nice. Just who she is. I know her. Sing back up for the band sometimes."</p>
                <p>"Really?"</p>
                <p>"Yeah, really. And she really is just nice. Damn kid, what were you thinking...?"</p>
                <p>The young server looked on as the head waiter went to greet the rock star, now joined by her companions. Probably fellow band members, he thought, also noting the presence of her raven-haired rock star sister, Ann.</p>
                <p>Completing a couple more tasks in the wait station, the young server then reluctantly returned to the table, now a scene of fashionable camaraderie, and awkwardly placed goblets of ice water and baskets of bread among the chattering group.</p>
                <p>Unable to disregard the magnitude of prominence  separating himself and the lovely woman whose prolonged gaze, only moments before, filled him with such elation, he now endeavored to avoid eye contact. And likely aware that he must now know of her cultural superiority, she probably did as well. </p>

                 <p>*In a Food processor blend well any soft bread to make crumbs. Remove from processor and place in a large bowl.<br/><em>*Thoroughly</em> dry all seafood.<br/>*Saute fennel (or onion) until soft.<br/>*Remove zest from lemon and chop to fine dice.</p>
                 <p>*Combine prawns, rice and egg in processor and blend until smooth. Remove and place in large bowl.<br/>*Pulse salmon and white fish in processor until well mixed but not pureed. This may need to be done in 2 or 3 batches, depending on the size of the processor. Combine and mix into prawns/rice/egg mixture.<br/>*Add fennel (or onion), tarragon, salt, pepper, lemon zest and squeeze in lemon juice, straining out seeds. Mix well. Combined ingredients should <u>not</u> be wet, and hold together firmly<br/>*Using a 2-3 oz ice cream scoop or 1/3 size measuring cup, scoop out seafood mix and roll into balls. Coat with bread crumbs, flatten into circular cakes and place onto a sheetpan.<br/>*Heat cooking oil in nonstick saucepan and saute over medium-low heat each side of cakes until golden. Do not overfill pan, and clean and re-oil between batches.<br/>*Place sauteed cakes onto paper towel-lined sheetpan to absorb excess oil.<br/>*When ready to serve place cakes onto nonstick saucepan. Pop into 400 deg. oven and bake for about 15 minutes.<br/>*When sufficiently cooked cakes should be firm, springy and slightly puffed.</p>
                 <p>*The magic of this recipe lies in the use of prawns and rice rather than breadcrumbs as a binding agent. Breadcrumbs invariably result in a bland,starchy cake that tends to fall apart when cooking.<br/>
                 *Scallops or crabmeat can of course be added or substituted. Be sure to thoroughly dry.<br/>
                 *Very nice with fruit salsas and reductions, mayonaise-based sauces, or just a squeeze of lemon.<br/> *A dry ros&egrave; should pair well, or just about any good white wine that is not heavily oaked.</p>

                 <h4>The Brothers Dumas</h4>
                 <p>Charm has many facets, many faces. Though different in essence Alexander and Frederick Dumas were both enormously charm-gifted. Raised in the gang-strewn south Seattle hood, neither Alex nor Fred were inclined towards the thuggish  lifestyle and attending thuggish attitude; preferring, rather, to interact with two distinct but equally effective versions of humor. And charm.</p>
                 <p>It was an upscale BBQ joint located on a busy corner of Capitol Hill, Seattle, where Alex and Fred worked. Alex was a prep cook, Fred a dishwasher. After a few years working front house gigs, I was back in the kitchen, painting ribs and grilling steaks at the same place. Walnut-hued, medium height and brawny, Alex was baritone-chatty, friendly, open, innocent. Fred was a shade darker, taller, leaner, and with a deeper voice that, though less active than his brother's had a tone of cleverness and irony. With only the slightest alteration in mannerism or expression either could be considered intimidating, even menacing. But neither seemed suited towards, or interested in, being thus - their appearances invariably reflecting geniality and humor.</p> 
                 <p>The restaurant's street level cooking line was behind the bar with an open view of the dining room and the busy Uptown streets beyond. During lunch and dinner service, myself and the other line cooks communicated by phone with the prep cooks and dishwashers, who worked in a windowless area, one floor below. In need of a red onion during a busy lunch one day I phoned the downstairs prep area, and Alex answered.</p>
                 <p>"Dumas Diner, chef speaking," He joked.<br/>
                 "Hey Alex, can you bring up a red onion."<br/>
                 "Okay!"<br/>
                 "Need it quick, please."<br/>
                 "Alright!"</p>
                 <p>It seemed too long a delay (when one is busy it always does, right?) but Alex finally did arrive. He gave me the onion. It was yellow. </p>
                 <p>"Didn't I ask for a red onion?"<br/>
                 "Yeah, but those other ones are purple...."</p>
                 <p>At the time it didn't seem too funny. But it sure does now.</p>

                 <h4>The Brothers Dumas 2</h4>
                 <p>I don't here wish to be misconstrued, for my meaning is not to insult. Alex was a wonderful, genuinely funny person. But at times, and largely due to his charming innocence, his best humor was not entirely intentional. And lest you think the brothers' names are falsified to mock, or - in the case of the last name "Dumas" - intended as a demeaning pun, you would be incorrect on both points. Their names as here written, both first and last, are genuine.</p>
                 <p>I could include other instances of Alex's charm, both witting and not, but the example written is a personal fave, and in keeping with the small plates theme should therefore suffice.</p>
                 <p>A particularly charming remembrance involving Fred occurred one evening the night before a Holiday dinner event at which turkey was to be served.</p>
                 <p>My good friend, and the restaurant's chef, Ed Hale (First-class <em>and</em> first-rate) and I were on the upstairs line preparing several turkeys to be roasted the following day. Needing some bread to make stuffing, I called the prep kitchen and in his deep bass voice, Fred answered:</p>
                 <p>"Boiler room!"<br/>"Hey Fred, could you bring up a couple of baguette loaves?"<br/> "Sure. Need 'em tonight?"<br/>"That's probably best, Fred."<br/>"Ok, get my peeps right on it."</p>
                 <p>Baguettes in hand, Fred lumbered up to the line and dropped them on the counter. Then pointing to a bag of giblets next to one of the turkeys, said:</p>         <p>"Is that its balls, and shit."<br/>"Sure is Fred,"  answered the chef.<br/>"So where's its penis?"</p>
                 <p>Skipping nary a beat chef Hale reached into the turkey and pulled out the neck.<br/>Following a few seconds silence Fred shook his head and smiled.</p>
                 <p>"Damn."</p>
