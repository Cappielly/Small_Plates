                <h4>Eric's New Hat</h4>
              <p>
                Eric came in through the back kitchen entrance sporting a fresh addition to his cook’s uniform: a just-purchased secondhand chef’s hat. Acquired at a nearby thrift store, it was one of the erect, starched-linen types with long vertical folds. Well used it no longer had the crisp white appearance of a new hat, but rather a faded and creamy yellow-beige hue. In squared black all caps letters the front of the hat's wide elastic band bore the phrase "KISS THE COOK", a curt invitation to any who may chance upon facing the hat's occupant.
              </p>
              <p>
                As he prepared for dinner service, Eric appeared both amused and pleased by his new acquisition. And he confided to his line-cook brethren, myself included, that he was looking forward to test the effectiveness of the hat’s bidding on a certain waitress whose undeniable beauty had always garnered his appreciation.
              </p>
              <p>
                At some point during the afternoon I took a glance at Eric’s hat and was struck by an idea. Then, shortly before the arrival of the dinner servers, I put my idea into action by plucking a single hair from my head and snipping off a small section of beige-colored labeling tape. With both hair and tape concealed in my hand, I then approached Eric. 
              </p>
              <p>
                “It’s a great hat Eric,”  I said. “but there’s a hair stuck right on the front of it.”
                I then brought my cupped hand up to his hat and lightly tapped in the piece of tape. Lowering my hand I then showed him the hair,  easily passing for one of his own, before letting it fall to the ground. 
              </p>
              <p>
                “Thanks,” he said, “If that wound up on a plate it could have traumatized someone.  Maybe even cost me my job”
              </p>
              <p>
                “Very true,” I replied, chuckling at the hyperbole. Then stepped back to review my work. Yes indeed, at only a short distance the masking tape was virtually invisible. And though  impairing the lettering's evenness a bit, was a near perfect match to the hat’s time-worn aspect.
              </p>
              <p>
                The night servers then began to enter the dining room, which was separated from the kitchen by a couple of swinging saloon doors. Soon each would be coming into the kitchen and interacting with the cooks as part of their work routine. I noticed a slightly stifled grin spread on Eric’s face as the voice of a certain undeniably beautiful sever was heard approaching the saloon doors. And as he prepared for the surprised giggle, and perhaps even a peck on the cheek, in response to KISS THE COOK; I braced for the very different, indeed wholly unpredictable response to:

              </p>
              <p>
                Substitute chef for composer and this aptly describes myself. I have worked in many good restaurants and learned from some very good chefs. I have also owned a couple of decent restaurants at which I was the menu's creator and principle cook, thus chef by default. And once I even held the esteemed position.

                But personally I could not care less for the title, nor have ever enthusiastically lobbied for the job. Cooking became a vocation  more out of immediate opportunity than any career-oriented forethought or passion for the craft. Learning to cook well has certainly been a benefit to myself, to those for whom I have cooked, and those for whom I have worked. But I have very seldom spent non-working hours studying different culinary techniques, and devising ways to produce ever-improved food concepts, as first-rate chefs invariably do.

                And though my cooking/hospality experience (I've done it all) certainly has not made me rich, nor my future secure, it has introduced me to many interesting places, circumstances, and people. And, embelleshed with a few preferred recipes, that’s what this modest work is about: written snapshots - literary small plates - of a first-class second-rate chef.

              <p>I took my first restaurant job at the age of 15. It was at a hole-in-the-wall place called Le Provencal in downtown Kirkland, Washington - a city now run amok with tech geeks, stupid high housing and pretension.  The exterior was just a plain, ground-level rectangle with a charcoal awning and an alley to the left that led back to the small, dingy kitchen. Inside the house was nice, though. Two candle lit rooms, one for regular dining the other for private parties. Dark wood furniture, wine-colored carpeting. Part rustic, part elegance.
              </p>
              <p>The owner, Philipe, was French and spoke with a heavy french accent. The waiters were French, and spoke with heavy french accents. There were two chefs. One a 20 something sadist named Larry. The other a chubby Mexican called Rios.           Another cook, the “salad boy,” was Dave Jepeski. A blonde, lanky guy with a jacked up Nova who was always flapping off.

               The plate washers were a couple of snooty high school senior babes. They worked a small, circular commercial dishwasher, and performed menial prep tasks like peeling garlic and potatoes.  
              </p>
              <p>
                My office was the pot and pan sink - to the immediate right of the chefs, the hot flat top, and gas burners. My tools of the trade water, soap and scrubbers. No machine.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was not a good kid at that stage of my life. A liar, thief, bad student, worse son. And I did drugs. Lots of ‘em.  But somehow I managed to make it through the job’s first month or so without getting the axe. Even though I usually showed up with a dope-addled brain. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I was on call one afternoon, hanging out with a friend who had managed to score some peyote, a yet untried experience. I had been on call a couple times before, and they never needed me. I figured they wouldn’t this night either. So going along with my friend I scraped the mildewy fuzz off some of the buttons and popped ‘em.
              </p>
              <p>
                A little while later I called the restaurant. The owner answered and told me to come in. It was gonna be a busy night.

                <p>Salt and pepper each side of thighs. In an oiled nonstick saucepan, cook skin side down over medium low heat until golden and crispy. Remove from pan and reserve.
                Pour out chicken fat from the saucepan, and reserve for other uses if desired.

                </p>
                <p>Place saucepan in preheated oven, making sure the liquid inside comes up to the skin but does not submerge it. Braise 45 minutes, periodically checking that a low simmer is maintained, and that the liquid stays at the lower level of the skin. If it falls below, heat a little water or chicken stock and replenish. The result should be fork tender flesh with contrasting light, crispy skin. 
                When chicken is finished set aside, place sauce on low heat and stir in a couple tablespoons butter. Ladle sauce on plates and place chicken on top, skin side up. Goes well with spuds, rice, pasta, polenta, etc. Garnish with parmesan, fresh basil, flavorful olives or aioli if desired. A dry ros&egrave; or medium bodied red should pair nicely.

               <p> It was a two mile walk to the restaurant, and I cursed the whole way. I hated the place, hated the work. And resented the idea of a good high interrupted. But after doing my first tasks, vacuuming the front and setting up the pot and pan area, my mind was still clear. Bad peyote, I supposed. Or not peyote at all. Really didn't know.</p>
               <p> Before dinner service staff was allowed to eat and goof off a bit before resuming work. After finishing a plate of Daube, a sort of french beef stew, I stepped outside with Jepeski. He pulled out a bag with some Colombian Gold in it and stuffed some in a pipe. I told him I popped some peyote buttons earlier but nothing was happening. He lit the pipe, inhaled, and offered it to me.</p> 
               <p>“Something will happen now," he said, exhaling smoke. We made short work of the bowl and went back in. It was good weed. I was nice and stoned and started slogging through my work.</p> 
               <p>So how you doin’ kid,” Rios asked, knowing, as all  kitchen staff and probably waiters too, that me and Jepeski were lit. So what. A little buzz. I could still work.
               </p>
               <p>“I’m doing just...”
               The peyote kicked in.
               “Whaa...?”<br/>
               “Yeah, I know kid. Tough question. Just try an' keep up. We gonna need stuff ASAP.”</p>
               <p>Don’t know why - probably shouldn’t have - but I drifted over to Jepeski and told him: “The peyote kicked in.” He looked at my face, into my eyes. “Wow, dude. You’re <em>seriously</em> baked. Got any more?”
               </p>
               <p>I was seriously baked. 
               And within a few minutes all staff knew I was seriously baked. Flapping Jepeski.</p>
               <p>As one might imagine, a lot of details are gone. But some impressions of the ensuing hilarity remain: Repeated barks of "HOT!" just as Larry sent red-glowing pans crashing into the sink scalding my arms; freakish smells of burnt butter, frog legs, sauce veloute and pink detergent blasting up my nose; <em>tons</em> of charred, greasy metal needing attention "ASAP!"; senior babes snarking me behind my back; french-gibbering waiters peering into my wasted eyes, pleading for <em>le peyot&egrave;</em>.... 
               </p>
               <p> But I made it. Didn't get canned or even told not to get so baked at work. Just how the placed rolled. Going home probably made short work of another bowl with Jepeski in his jacked up Nova.</p>

               <h4>Nancy</h4>
               <p>It was a sunny late summer afternoon. Except for the lone woman seated at a table with a fine veiw of Lake Washington, the restaurant was empty. Observing her from the the opposite end of the dining room, the young server was struck by her apparent beauty. And by how much she reminded him of Nancy. For most of the previous year Nancy and he had been together, as happy as any two could hope to be.</p>
               <p>Prior to his time with Nancy, nearly all of his teen  years had been a tragedy of drugs, lying and thievery. But during those wasted years he yet managed to keep his french restaurant job, advancing from dishwasher to pantry cook. And it was there, shortly after Nancy became employed as a hostess, where they met and began a relationship. And as their intimacy solidified her wholesomeness helped to change his self-destructive ways. Hence his mind was now clear, his days fruitful, and his future bright. But since only a short time had elapsed since Nancy had been compelled to move quite far away, his thoughts were distracted, his heart heavy.</p>
               <p>Balancing a filled water goblet upon a circular tray, he approached the solitary customer. The nearer proximity revealed traits differing from Nancy, but also confirmed his more distant impression: she was indeed beautiful. The shoulder-length of her hair was about the same as Nancy's and cast a similar golden sheen, but was styled with shorter, more defined waves. Her eyes a purer, darker blue than the grey-blue eyes of Nancy. The contour of her face was, like Nancy's, a pleasing elongated oval, but with a touch more prominence to her cheeks and chin. And though still posessing a vibrant youthful bloom, she was clearly older than Nancy, perhaps by six or seven years, he thought.</p>
               <p>"Good afternoon," he said, placing the goblet on the table. "How are you?"</p> <p>Turning her attention from the gem-sparkling view, she looked directly at him. And after a moment's pause smiled warmly and responded:</p>
               <p>"I'm fine, thank you. How are you?"</p>                   <p>"I'm fine," he said, slightly unnerved by the undisguised affection that her steady gaze communicated. Following another brief pause and still in the magic of her warm, lovely gaze, he focused back on the job at hand:</p>
               <p>"Would you care for anything else at this time?"</p>
               <p>"No. Water will be fine until my friends arrive."</p>
               <p>The thought of her friends' arrival seeming to divert her attention from the server, she resumed looking out the window towards the lake. But as he turned to depart, she looked to him once more.</p>
               <p>"Thank you," she said. "You're very sweet."</p>

               <p>After using the contents of that jar of liquid-brined kalamata olives, artichokes, sweet peppers, or capers keep both the jar and liquid. For a quick, tasty salad, vegetable or fish dressing add to the brine 5 parts mayo to 1 part mustard of you choice (I generally prefer dijon). Cover jar tightly and shake until smooth.</p> 
               <p>Adjust to desired thickness by adding more liquid or mayo/mustard. Experiment by adding any number of ingredients such as chopped garlic, fresh or dried herbs, vinegar, parmesan, etc.</p> 
               <p>For a nice on the fly Caesar dressing start with a fairly thick brine/mustard/mayo base. Add Worcestershire, finely chopped garlic, fresh lemon juice, balsamic vinegar, fresh cracked black pepper, a bit of extra virgin olive oil, and a shake or two tabasco. Add a finely chopped anchovie too, if that's your fancy.</p>

                <p>Turning to face her he again noted the genuine warmth and affection of her gaze as she held his eyes.</p>
                <p>His equilibrium suddenly shattered, he was yet able to mumble a shy "thanks" before she returned her attention to the lake.</p>
                <p>From the moment he met Nancy and indeed throughout their relationship, her presence invariably had a mellowing effect on his spirit. This was not a result of blunted interest or want of excitement, but rather a manifestation of profound compatability. Similarly attuned to life and its vagaries they were, by extention, naturally attuned to each other. They were close in age and status, enjoyed many of the same activities and pleasantries, were alike in temprament, and physically and mentally complimentary. They were content together during idleness, play, passion or silence. With Nancy he was always at ease.</p>
                <p>It was a perfect contrast to how he now felt. And walking the length of the dining room to the waiter's station, the young server wasn't sure if he could complete the journey without toppling over. His heart raced, his limbs trembled, and his suddenly untethered mind reeled in a crazy delerium of alien intoxication. He knew nothing of this golden haired beauty, but her unabashed affection and simple compliment filled him with an intense blast of confusion and joy.</p>
                <p>Entering the wait station, young server began organizing for evening service when the head waiter arrived. Tall, charismatic, and a decade his senior, the head waiter was more than a little intimidating to the younger man, who typically was hesitant to initiate any conversation not related to the job. At this time, however, he needed to vent some of the emotion surging through his nerves. Hence overcoming his accustomed timidity, he paused briefly to compose his rambling thoughts and spoke:
                </p>
                <p>"There's uh, uh, a lady out there. Table 10. Very beautiful. Um, seems to like me."</p>
                <p>Moving to the doorless arch separating the wait station from the dining area, the head waiter peered in the direction of the lone customer. Then with an expression of amused disbelief looked back to his  associate.</p>

                <p>"You don't know who that is?" he asked.</p>
                <img id="nan" src="nancy.PNG" alt="Nancy">
                <p>"No."</p>
                <p>"That's Nancy."</p>
                <p><em>"Nancy?</em> Well that's a...."</p>
                <p>"Nancy Wilson"</p>
                <p>"Oh. Nancy Wilson?"</p>
                <p>"Oh come on, you can't be that sheltered. You never heard Magic Man....Crazy On You....Never heard of Heart?"</p>
                <p>"<em>Ahh.</em> Well yes. Sure I have. But she, she was really nice....Said I was...."</p>
                <p>"Yeah, well she is really nice. Just who she is. I know her. Sing back up for the band sometimes."</p>
                <p>"Really?"</p>
                <p>"Yeah, really. And she really is just nice. Damn kid, what were you thinking...?"</p>
                <p>The young server looked on as the head waiter went to greet the rock star, now joined by her companions. Probably fellow band members, he thought, also noting the presence of her raven-haired rockstar sister.</p>
                <p>Completing a couple more tasks in the wait station, the young server then reluctantly returned to the table, now a scene of fashionable camaraderie, and awkwardly placed goblets of ice water and baskets of bread among the chattering group.</p>
                <p>Unable to disregard the great chasm suddenly thrust between himself and the lovely woman whose prolonged gaze, only moments before, filled him with such elation, he now endeavored to avoid eye contact. And likely aware that he must now know of her superstar ranking, she probably did as well. </p>

                 <h4>The Brothers Dumas</h4>
                 <p>Charm has many forms, many facets, many faces. Though different in essence Alexander and Frederick Dumas were both enormously charm-gifted. Raised in the south Seattle hood, neither Alex nor Fred were inclined towards the rap-culture thuggery common to the area; preferring, rather, to interact with two distinct but equally effective versions of humor, and charm.</p>
                 <p>It was an upscale BBQ joint located on a busy corner of Capitol Hill, Seattle, where Alex and Fred worked. Alex was a prep cook, Fred a dishwasher. After a few years working front house gigs, I was back in the kitchen, painting ribs and grilling steaks at the same place. Walnut-hued, medium height and fit, Alex was baritone-chatty, friendly, open, innocent. Fred was a shade darker, taller, leaner, and with a deeper voice that, though less active than his brother's had a tone of cleverness and irony. With only a slight alteration in demeanor or expression either could have looked intimidating, even menacing. But neither seemed suited towards, or interested in, being thus - their appearances invariably projecting geniality and humor.</p> 
                 <p>The restaurant's street level cooking line was behind the bar with an open view of the dining room and the busy Uptown streets beyond. During lunch and dinner service, myself and the other line cooks communicated by phone with the prep cooks and dishwashers, who worked in a spacious preparation area, one floor below. In need of a red onion during a busy lunch one day I phoned downstairs and Alex answered.</p>
                 <p>"Dumas Diner, chef speaking," He joked.<br/>
                 "Hey Alex, can you bring up a red onion."<br/>
                 "Okay!"<br/>
                 "Need it quick, please."<br/>
                 "Alright!"</p>
                 <p>It seemed too long a delay (when one is busy it always does, right?) but Alex finally did arrive. He gave me the onion. It was yellow. </p>
                 <p>"Didn't I ask for a red onion?"<br/>
                 "Yeah, but those other ones are purple...."</p>
                 <p>Funny. And <em>charming.</em></p>

                 <h4>The Brothers Dumas 2</h4>
                 <p>If to insult seems to be the intention of the above anecdote then I have been misconstrued. Alex was a wonderful, genuinely amusing person. But as with us all there were times - largely due to his charming innocence - that his humor was not entirely intentional. And lest you think the brothers' names are falsified to mock, or - in the case of the last name "Dumas" - intended as a demeaning pun, you would be wrong on both points. Their names as here written, both first and last, are genuine.</p>
                 <p>Other instances of Alex's charm, both witting and not, I could include in this brief portrait, but prefer to move on to one involving his brother Fred, who was equally ready and able to amuse.</p>
                 <p>One night before a Holiday dinner event my good friend chef Ed Hale, (First-class <em>and</em> first-rate) and I were on the upstairs line preparing a few turkeys. Needing some bread to make stuffing, I called the prep kitchen and in his deep bass voice, Fred answered:</p>
                 <p>"Boiler room!"<br/>"Hey Fred, can you bring up a couple loaves of bread?"<br/> "Sure. Need 'em tonight?"<br/>"That's probably best, Fred."<br/>"Ok, get my peeps right on it."</p>
                 <p>A loaf in each hand, Fred lumbered up to the line and dropped them on the counter. Then pointing to a bag of giblets next to one of the turkeys, asked:</p>         
                 <p>"That its balls?"<br/> "Sure is Fred,"  answered the chef.<br/> "What're they doing in the bag?"<br/> "In case anyone wants to eat 'em, I guess."<br/>"Hmm. So where's its penis?"</p>
                 <p>Skipping nary a beat chef Hale reached into the turkey and pulled out the neck.<br/>Following a few seconds silence Fred shook his head and smiled.</p>
                 <p>"Damn."</p>

                       <p>After cooking pasta, don't rinse. Not only does rinsing make pasta soggy, it also removes much of the pasta's  flavor. When pasta is done strain into colander and work in a little salt and enough olive oil to keep the pasta from clumping together. If using immediately in a tossed pasta place directly into the pan containing the other ingredients. Cook gently to reduce excess liquid (if needed) toss and serve. If making sauce topped pasta, such as spaghetti and meatballs, allow to drain for a minute or so before placing onto plates and topping with sauce. If using pasta at a later time, thinly spread onto a sheet pan. When cool place in well-sealed container or plasic bag.</p>

                       <h4>Celebrity Chef 1</h4>
                       <p>It was un upscale brewery restaurant in downtown Seattle at which the celebrity chef was recently hired. That he refused to even taste the fine beer struck me as odd, but of little consequence. Of greater consequence was the veiled dislike he had for me from the very start of his employment; and which only a short time hence  developed into undisguised hatred.</p>
                       <p>I had been working at the place since before it opened, finishing the wooden dining tables, organizing the kitchen equipment, cleaning, etc. It was a beautiful place with wood-and-copper-fronted beer tanks inside a spacious, open dining area; and a gorgeous solid-copper, half-circle-shaped bar. The owner was British as were the lesser-carbonated, lightly-chilled ales. Once open I worked the grill and saut&egrave; stations at night, a key position. And I was very good at my job.</p>
                       <p>My afore-mentioned friend Ed Hale was the original chef, but upon securing a position with 
                       former collegue and rising-star-chef Norman Van Aken at a new Florida restaurant, he gave his notice and left. A solid replacement, chef Tom Clauson, was then hired, did an admirable job, and became something of a friend as well. But after just a few months he gave his notice and began the interviewing process for another kitchen head.</p>
                       <p>At some point during his interviews chef Tom told me that one interested applicant was something of Los Angeles celebrity, having been sous (assistant) chef to Wolfgang Puck at one of his (Puck's) successful ventures. I was intrigued and voiced my not insignificant support to hire him.</p>
                       <p>Soon after chosen to be the restaurant's 3rd chef, the L.A. celebrity came on to the line to meet me. He was a gruff, somewhat neanderthal-esque looking dude and after a brief introduction in a growly voice asked:<p/>
                       <p>"So, does it get pretty hot in here?"</p>
                       <p>The kitchen being open and adjacent to the temperature controlled dining area - hence clearly not a particularly hot cooking envirnment - the question seemed odd. I told him no, the kitchen wasn't particularly hot.</p>
                       <p>"Does it get pretty stressful?"</p>
                       <p>"Sometimes, but not more than any other line cooking job," I answered, again thinking the question odd, as though he was fishing for a certain response. During that first encounter I noticed as well that though he was smiling and acting friendly, something about his manner betrayed annoyance. And his eyes were hostile.</p> 
                    </div>
                    <div class="col celeb chef2">
                      <p id="center">14</p>
                      <h4>Celebrity Chef 2</h4>
                        <p>Shortly after the L.A. chef was hired, another California guy was brought on to replace the General Manager. An openly gay San Franciscan, the new GM didn't seem to take a shine to me either.</p>           <p>I imagine it is not unusual for new management to have some resentment for  well-entrenched staff, as I was; and especially those with a strong and postitive relationship with the owner - as I had. But whereas the new GM's mild annoyance seemed typical new boss/subordinate stuff, the chef's ever-mounting  contempt, and attendant rudeness, badgering and temper flare-ups - towards me alone - were becomming increasingly <em>atypical</em> and concerning.</p>
                        <p>One night, however, he came onto the kitchen line with a smile again a obscuring the wrath of his eyes, and began a conversation thus:</p>
                        <p>"<em>Je pence donc je sui."</em></p>
                        <p>Never having given him any indication that I spoke French, it was yet again another of the chef's conversational oddities. But at least the smile was back, so I played along and asked what he meant. Visibly proud of his achievement he translated the quote, "I think therefore I am," and told me the quote's author, Rene Descartes.</p>     <p> How long he worked on this performance was hard to know, but it was clearly contrived and ill-suited his gruff, neanderthal manner. But the pretense of refinement seemed to ease his hostility, and he went on to inform me that in addition to philosophy some of his other cultured enjoyments included painting, reading and classical music. Letting him know I was a reader and classical music enthusiast as well, a temporary truce seemed to ensue at which time he began a surprisingly normal line of inquiry.<p>
                        </p>
                        <p>"Hey I'm lookin' for a more permanent place to live around here," he said. "Tryin' to get an idea of some of the neighborhoods. Where do you live?"</p>
                        <p>At the time I was living in a residential section of Capitol Hill, and so told him. </p>
                        <p>"What's it like? Do you like it there?"</p>    
                    </div>
                    <div class="col celeb chef3">
                      <p id="center">15</p>
                      <h4>Celebrity Chef 3</h4>
                        <p>I was living a few blocks up from the busy, central part of Capitol Hill. It was a quiet part of the hill, but there were some nice shops and restaurants within a couple of blocks; and the general area had a pleasing balance of greenery and interesting homes and buildings. I really liked living there, and told him. At the time Capitol Hill also had - likely still does - a notably large gay community, and I informed him of this as well. And of course there was the bustling central area replete of clubs, bars and eateries of all types, a stylish and unique shopping mall, and a couple of wonderful old-school movie theaters. Capitol Hill was an eclectic and exciting place for a youth such as myself. I really did like living there.</p>
                        <p>Whether or not my enthusiasm for the place had any impact on the chef's decision, I never did find out. But as time passed there were things about <em>him</em> I absolutely did learn. First was that he was of that managerial breed which vastly prefers swinging a clipboard, yakking on the phone and basking in the schmooze of sales people, over any genuine labor. And that was probably a good thing since those rare times when he deigned to enter the cooking line and make a plate of food, it inevitably was an embarrassment to all but himself. And when the place was jammed and he was needed on the line he quite often fell apart. A good example of this occurred one evening prior to a late Seahawk game, not long before my termination. The place was slammed and every line cook was tasked with a multitude of orders needing immediate attention. In spite of how busy it was I watched in awe as the celebrity chef stuggled with a paltry order of two tomato-and-cream-based seafood pastas. After placing the pasta and seafood into the pans he was then clearly befuddled over how to proceed. Embittered and ashamed, he reluctantly caught my eye and asked what to do.</p>
                        <p>"Deglaze with wine and add tomato sauce," I told him, "and finish with cream." He then commenced to  babble repeatedly "yes, cream, cream!" while adding  <em>just cream</em> to the pans before slopping his finished work into bowls bound for two unfortunate patrons.</p>
                        <p>Likely stinging from his observed incompetence, the chef never again tried to mask his seething hostility, and going forward even refused to speak to me. Meanwhile I was hearing from a couple of other line cooks how favored they were by the L.A. chef, and how according to him they were destined to become his new "dream team."</p>
                        <p>I wasn't sure how the new chef was going to sell his decision to fire me to the owner, but the scent was in the air; the writing on the wall: I was on my way out.</p>

Angel hair pasta may also be used instead of noodles. Try a slightly sweet chilled saki, off-dry white, or light Pinot Noir to accompany.<br/>*This soy dressing is quite versitile. Among other things it makes a nice beef marinade, pork or fish glaze, or spinach salad dressing.

                        <h4>Celebrity Chef 4</h4>
                        <p>Soon after, during a day off the owner, Richard, called and informed me that I was fired; that both the chef and GM told him it needed to happen; and that as much as it distressed him, he had to respect their desire. Instructing me to come in later to pick up my final check, he then said we could discuss further details of their reasoning if I wanted.</p>
                        <p>I arrived at the restaurant in the evening and joined Richard who was sitting at the bar clasping a full pint of blond ale. Upon telling him I did want to hear why I was fired he asked the bartender to bring me a pint as well, and in his cultured British-accent, started explaining.</p>
                        <p>"The chef insists you're a homophobe, and has convinced the GM of it. He said you told him not to move to Capital Hill because of the prominent gay presence there. And said that you said gay people disgust you."</p>
                        <p>It was incredible. "Um, really?"</p>
                        <p>"Yes."</p>
                        <p>"But..you don't believe that...do you?"</p>
                        <p>"I don't know. Considering your friendship with Robin [a gay fellow line cook who indeed was a friend] it doesn't really make sense."</p>
                        <p>"The chef is lying," I said, fury mounting and making it hard to speak calmly. "He's absolutely lying. Has wanted me gone since he was hired. Despises me."</p>
                        <p>"I'm afraid I must respect their decision. It's because -"</p>
                        <p>"But this is absurd," I cut in. "I told him I <em>like</em> living on Capitol Hill."</p>
                        <p>"Did you say anything about the gay presence there?"</p>
                        <p>"He asked me what it was like. I told him there was a large gay community. Never said they disgust me. I...I can't believe this."</p>

                       <h4>Celebrity Chef 5</h4>
                       <p>"Well the problem is the GM believes him - you know he's gay, right? - and they both consider it grounds for your removal. And since I did hire the both of them to manage - to make the important decisions - it is necessary for me to show them my confidence. I'm very sorry."</p>
                       <p>"But...Richard listen...<b>what that manipulative jackass of an incompetant chef said <em>isn't true</em></b>....I <em>knew</em> there was something wrong with this guy... He's fucking off, Richard. Whacked. <em>Bad."</em></p>
                       <p>For a while we thus continued but Richard would not relent. My argument was not to prevail. The celebrity chef would have his way.</p>
                       <p>Finding another job was not an issue. Within a couple of weeks I was working the saut&egrave; station at an upscale Italian restaurant near the waterfront. A few months after I got a call from my friend Chef Ed Hale, asking if I wanted to work with him at the Van Aken's venture. I did indeed and planned for it. En route, however, about thirty miles west of Las Vegas my car caught fire and was destroyed. After three days mulling things over in Pahrump Nevada, I decided to take a rental car to beautiful Lake Tahoe, and try my luck there.</p>
                       <p>I was a year in Tahoe and loved it. And would have remained had I not let a girl who I was then with convince me to move back with her to the northwest, so she could finish her studies at Western Washington University.</p>
                       <p>Back in the Northwest, I eventually made it in to the brewery restaurant. The celebrity chef was gone. I asked Richard what had happened, and he said the chef got too burned out to handle things. After another year or so, I checked back  and the place had changed ownership.</p>
                       <p>Several years hence I was working with a guy who had worked with the L.A. celebrity chef as well. He told me the reason for him leaving L.A. was due to some scandel he was embroiled in. Curious I later googled <b>L.A. celebrity chef,</b> and his name: <b>John Sweeney.</b> And among other tragic reporting, read this:</p>

                       <h4>And She Called Me A Liar</h4>
                       <p>It was a swank restaurant, lounge and tennis club in the heart of Incline Village, Lake Tahoe. I had only been in Tahoe a few days, and this was my first job interview. The chef was tall and direct, and in a strong, commanding voice asked me if I had cooking experience. "Yes." Then asked if I had <em>French</em> cooking experience. "Yes." Then told me I was hired and to start the following day. <em>Gard Manger</em> position. My job was line preparation of salads, appetizers and desserts.</p>
                       <p>The chef's last name was identical in pronunciation to that of a then famous chef, one Roger Verg&eacute;, (Ver-<em>jhay)</em> and during one of my first days working with him, I asked if there was any relation. To my surprise he said there was, that Roger Verg&eacute; was his Uncle. Knowing nothing of the chef I had no reason to doubt him, but as the cloth-stenciled spelling on his chef's jacket didn't match that of my recollection of the French master's last name, I was a bit mystified. Out of curiosity the next day I went to the library and located one of Chef Verg&eacute;'s books. The spelling was, as I thought, different from that of my current boss. Quite different.</p>
                       <p>The Tahoe Chef liked my work, and we soon became friends. He was a fine chef, professionally trained and gifted with an excellent palate and nose. He was also self-confident, tremendously charismatic, popular with women and very at ease with the local celebrities. </p>
                       <p>Before long we were goofing off together outside of work. Checking out new places to have lunch. Sneaking into the restaurant after closing hours to snag a bottle of wine, "<em>I've got a key!</em>." Dinner with the  wives - I was recently maried, he for a few years. Playing blackjack at the Hyatt. And when winter arrived, skiing at one of the many nearby resorts. We had many good times, I really liked the man. It was fun to be with him. Even as it became clear that he really was a bad sort, and a big time liar.</p>

                      <h4>And She Called Me A Liar 2</h4>
                      <p>To me it made no sense. He was popular and accomplished. There didn't seem to be any sound reason to fabricate his experiences or embellish his rich, active life, but that he did. A great deal.</p>                   <p>Of course he was not nephew to Roger Verg&eacute;. Nor, as plainly evident by his clumsy skiing, had he ever been an instructor - though insisting to me he had. Nor was he a "semi pro" golfer as a waiter told me the chef had claimed, before playing a round with him and witnessing "the lamest game ever." During spirited conversation many of his truth-sworn reminiscences, however funny and forcefully told, were obvious lies - at least to those who had come to know him. And in particular obvious to his sweet, adoring wife who, regardless of the falsehood's transparency would simply look to him smiling and say: "Oh, honey." But never once did I hear the veracity of his tales challenged. He was a king among subjects.</p>
                      <p>As plentiful as were the chef's lies was his infidelity. At length becoming both friend and confidant I was increasingly made familiar with the details of the chef's cheating, as well as with some of the side-girls themselves who often would show up late at the restaurant before leaving with him.</p>
                      <p>At some point the chef even rented a small apartment to more easily facilitate encounters with a new babe that he seemed especially fond of. Quite in opposition to his sweet, naive wife the current  paramour - who was now regularly dropping by the restaurant - walked, dressed, laughed and generally behaved like a tramp. But there was no question regarding her allure. Clearly enamored, the chef even admitted to me that of all his side babes, she was the most exciting, and that he could even imagine divorcing his wife for her. A naturally happy, bouyant person, with this new hottie in his life he was positively elated.</p>
                      <p>One day, however, he came to the restaurant down, way down. Quiet, sullen, brooding, I'd never seen him thus. After a few hours wondering what could be the cause of his distress, he told me his new girlfriend said she couldn't take him anymore, and broke up. Then looking to me with a wounded expression of utter sadness and offense, said:</p>

                      <p>Shortly after the chef's girl broke up with him a beautiful, sultry blonde was hired to seat customers. Before long she and the chef were leaving together, and he was again of good cheer.</p>
                      <p>As previously written, the Chef was a man at ease even with the rich and famous. David Coverdale, lead singer of the rock band "White Snake" lived in the area, was a regular customer and buddy to the chef. And at the time Mr. Coverdale was recording an album with legendary Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page - also now a regular restaurant patron, and chummy with the chef as well.</p>
                      <p>At some point during the guitar great's Tahoe sojourn, he consented to play with a local rock band in the restaurant's lounge. Though a small venue - 100 person capacity, perhaps - the band erected an impressive stack of amplifiers, which, upon hopping up to the bar-sized stage, Mr. Page gave instructions to "crank 'er up."</p>
                      <p>Though it literally pained me to do so, I watched the entire hour-or-so-long performance from the right edge of the stage, directly in front of the right side amps, no more than six or seven  feet from the rock and roll legend, himself. Looking to be in his mid-forties, Mr. Page's physical presence was less than impressive. No longer the ripped, axe-slashing superstud in gleaming leather bell bottoms, Page was now hunched and scrawny with lots of grey in the yet long rock-n-roll hairdo. And he had a grotesque way of contorting his face and thrusting out his aging lips when playing. But his guitar mastery was truly impressive. Hence, in spite of his frumpy, oddball demeanor (and the deafening noise level) I was happy to have witnessed the show.</p>
                      <p>After the performance the rock star sat at a table sipping beer with his girlfriend (or wife), a brawny, long-haired bodyguard, and a few idolizing strangers bold enough to hang with a legend. To his immediate right also sat the chef. Suffering from hearing loss that would last three or four days, I sat at the bar unobtrusively (I hoped) observing.</p>
                      <p>With most of the table's attention focused on the chattering guitarist and chef, there suddenly occurred a burst of loud, prolonged laughter from the entire group. Partially deaf and a bit far away to comprehend the levity, I  asked the chef about it when at length he approached the bar for a drink refill. He was happy to answer. Evidentally a coven of she-satanists knew Page was in town, were furtively dogging his activities, and some were even at present in the lounge. Mr. Page, apparently, respresented an extremely elevated status - near to satan himself - in their dark belief's hierarchy. The chef then said that upon being  informed of this the rock legend grinned and in his high-pitched heavily Brit-accented voice (admirably mimicked by the chef) quipped:</p>
                      <p>"Don't really mind who they think I am, really. Long as they gimme  sa'issfaction in the bathroom."</p>
                      <p>As curious as any rock fan of the comings and goings of a true legend, I yet declined to wait for confirmation.</p>

                      <h4>Let's Give Him A Hand!</h4>
                      <p>Though his wife was now with child, the chef's relationship with the blonde hostess continued, increasing in its seriousness. Always a bit heavy, he was now working out, toning up, slimming down and visiting tanning booths as well - physical changes that became increasingly noticible and were likely at the new gal's insistence.</p>
                      <p>Also changing were his dinner specials. Previously creating pretty much exclusively French, or Italian (at times) cuisines, he was more and more working with  traditionally Asian foods and flavors. Curries, tandouri, peanut sauces, sticky rice and rice noodles, spicy chilies, sesame oil, etc. were being substituted for, or combined with the restaurant's usual Mediterranean fare.</p>
                      <p>One day I asked why the changes, and he told me:</p>
                      <p>"We're going to Santa Fe. Opening up an Asian-Fusion place. Calling it "The Edge." <br/>"Really? You mean you and the new hottie?" I asked.<br/>"Hey! Don't talk about her like that. She can read too, you know."<br/>"I'm sure she can," I said, surprised by the intensity of his umbrage."And didn't mean to imply she couldn't."<br/>"Well anyway, yeah, that's what's going on. You wanna come with us?"</p>
                      <p>Having already committed to move back to the Northwest, I told him no, I couldn't. And decided it was probably best not to ask about his wife and unborn kid.</p>
                      <p>Not long after the entire staff was compelled to attend a meeting to be conducted by the financing owner. A guy as dopey as he was rich - and he was quite rich - it would no doubt prove to be little more than time wasted.</p>
                      <p>The meeting time came and my suspicions were confirmed. Phrases like "effectuating positive," "zeroing in on the excellence," and "fluid client responsiveness" tumbled forth, sedating all but the usual grandstanding sycophants into a groggy stupor.</p>
                      <p>Winding it up, his last order of business was to heartily thank the chef for his excellent work.<br/>"You've done a great job chef....Let's give him a hand!" he concluded, and all obeyed.</p>
                      <p>Beaming, the chef    raised his fists and pumped them above his head in victory. </p>
                      <p>The following day the chef did not show up for work, nor would there ever again. Word then spread that during the previous night someone with a key entered and robbed the place blind.</p>

                         *When potatoes are about half done, in a saut&eacute; pan cook chopped garlic in 1/2 stick of butter over low heat.<br/>*When garlic is soft, add cream and warm on low heat, do not boil.<br/>*When potatoes are well softened, thoroughly strain, place in separate bowl, add cream/garlic and mash.**<br/>*Evenly separate spuds and blend yellow liquid  into one half and red the other.<br/>*Enough of the respective liquids should be added to give each half of potatoes good pink/yellow color.<br/>*Spoon separated spuds into pastry bags and pipe onto plates. 
                         <p>**There are several ways for potatoes to be mashed. The simplest is a masher, of course, but you can also blend with a mixer, run through a ricer, or smash through a pasta strainer with a ladle.</p>
