                <h4>Eric's New Hat</h4>
              <p>
                Eric came in through the back kitchen entrance sporting a fresh addition to his cook’s uniform: a just-purchased secondhand chef’s hat. Acquired at a nearby thrift store, it was one of the erect, starched-linen types with long vertical folds. Well used it no longer had the crisp white appearance of a new hat, but rather a faded and creamy yellow-beige hue. In squared black all caps letters the front of the hat's wide elastic band bore the phrase "KISS THE COOK", a curt invitation to any who may chance upon facing the hat's occupant.
              </p>
              <p>
                As he prepared for dinner service, Eric appeared both amused and pleased by his new acquisition. And he confided to his line-cook brethren, myself included, that he was looking forward to test the effectiveness of the hat’s bidding on a certain waitress whose undeniable beauty had always garnered his appreciation.
              </p>
              <p>
                At some point during the afternoon I took a glance at Eric’s hat and was struck by an idea. Then, shortly before the arrival of the dinner servers, I put my idea into action by plucking a single hair from my head and snipping off a small section of beige-colored labeling tape. With both hair and tape concealed in my hand, I then approached Eric. 
              </p>
              <p>
                “It’s a great hat Eric,”  I said. “but there’s a hair stuck right on the front of it.”
                I then brought my cupped hand up to his hat and lightly tapped in the piece of tape. Lowering my hand I then showed him the hair,  easily passing for one of his own, before letting it fall to the ground. 
              </p>
              <p>
                “Thanks,” he said, “If that wound up on a plate it could have traumatized someone.  Maybe even cost me my job”
              </p>
              <p>
                “Very true,” I replied, chuckling at the hyperbole. Then stepped back to review my work. Yes indeed, at only a short distance the masking tape was virtually invisible. And though  impairing the lettering's evenness a bit, was a near perfect match to the hat’s time-worn aspect.
              </p>
              <p>
                The night servers then began to enter the dining room, which was separated from the kitchen by a couple of swinging saloon doors. Soon each would be coming into the kitchen and interacting with the cooks as part of their work routine. I noticed a slightly stifled grin spread on Eric’s face as the voice of a certain undeniably beautiful sever was heard approaching the saloon doors. And as he prepared for the surprised giggle, and perhaps even a peck on the cheek, in response to KISS THE COOK; I braced for the very different, indeed wholly unpredictable response to:

              </p>
              <p>
                Substitute chef for composer and this aptly describes myself. I have worked in many good restaurants and learned from some very good chefs. I have also owned a couple of decent restaurants at which I was the menu's creator and principle cook, thus chef by default. And once I even held the esteemed position.

                But personally I could not care less for the title, nor have ever enthusiastically lobbied for the job. Cooking became a vocation  more out of immediate opportunity than any career-oriented forethought or passion for the craft. Learning to cook well has certainly been a benefit to myself, to those for whom I have cooked, and those for whom I have worked. But I have very seldom spent non-working hours studying different culinary techniques, and devising ways to produce ever-improved food concepts, as first-rate chefs invariably do.

                And though my cooking/hospality experience (I've done it all) certainly has not made me rich, nor my future secure, it has introduced me to many interesting places, circumstances, and people. And, embelleshed with a few preferred recipes, that’s what this modest work is about: written snapshots - literary small plates - of a first-class second-rate chef.

              <p>I took my first restaurant job at the age of 15. It was at a hole-in-the-wall place called Le Provencal in downtown Kirkland, Washington - a city now run amok with tech geeks, stupid high housing and pretension.  The exterior was just a plain, ground-level rectangle with a charcoal awning and an alley to the left that led back to the small, dingy kitchen. Inside the house was nice, though. Two candle lit rooms, one for regular dining the other for private parties. Dark wood furniture, wine-colored carpeting. Part rustic, part elegance.
              </p>
              <p>The owner, Philipe, was French and spoke with a heavy french accent. The waiters were French, and spoke with heavy french accents. There were two chefs. One a 20 something sadist named Larry. The other a chubby Mexican called Rios.           Another cook, the “salad boy,” was Dave Jepeski. A blonde, lanky guy with a jacked up Nova who was always flapping off.
               </p>
               <p>
               The plate washers were a couple of snooty high school senior babes. They worked a small, circular commercial dishwasher, and performed menial prep tasks like peeling garlic and potatoes.  
              </p>
              <p>
                My office was the pot and pan sink - to the immediate right of the chefs, the hot flat top, and gas burners. My tools of the trade water, soap and scrubbers. No machine.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was not a good kid at that stage of my life. A liar, thief, bad student, worse son. And I did drugs. Lots of ‘em.  But somehow I managed to make it through the job’s first month or so without getting the axe. Even though I usually showed up with a dope-addled brain. 
              </p>
              <p>
                I was on call one afternoon, hanging out with a friend who had managed to score some peyote, a yet untried experience. I had been on call a couple times before, and they never needed me. I figured they wouldn’t this night either. So going along with my friend I scraped the mildewy fuzz off some of the buttons and popped ‘em.
              </p>
              <p>
                A little while later I called the restaurant. The owner answered and told me to come in. It was gonna be a busy night.

                <p>Salt and pepper each side of thighs. In an oiled nonstick saucepan, cook skin side down over medium low heat until golden and crispy. Remove from pan and reserve.
                Pour out chicken fat from the saucepan, and reserve for other uses if desired.

                </p>
                <p>Place saucepan in preheated oven, making sure the liquid inside comes up to the skin but does not submerge it. Braise 45 minutes, periodically checking that a low simmer is maintained, and that the liquid stays at the lower level of the skin. If it falls below, heat a little water or chicken stock and replenish. The result should be fork tender flesh with contrasting light, crispy skin. 
                When chicken is finished set aside, place sauce on low heat and stir in a couple tablespoons butter. Ladle sauce on plates and place chicken on top, skin side up. Goes well with spuds, rice, pasta, polenta, etc. Garnish with parmesan, fresh basil, flavorful olives or aioli if desired. A dry ros&egrave; or medium bodied red should pair nicely.

               <p> It was a two mile walk to the restaurant, and I cursed the whole way. I hated the place, hated the work. And resented the idea of a good high interrupted. But after doing my first tasks, vacuuming the front and setting up the pot and pan area, my mind was still clear. Bad peyote, I supposed. Or not peyote at all. Really didn't know.</p>
               <p> Before dinner service staff was allowed to eat and goof off a bit before resuming work. After finishing a plate of Daube, a sort of french beef stew, I stepped outside with Jepeski. He pulled out a bag with some Colombian Gold in it and stuffed some in a pipe. I told him I popped some peyote buttons earlier but nothing was happening. He lit the pipe, inhaled, and offered it to me.</p> 
               <p>“Something will happen now," he said, exhaling smoke. We made short work of the bowl and went back in. It was good weed. I was nice and stoned and started slogging through my work.</p> 
               <p>So how you doin’ kid,” Rios asked, knowing, as all  kitchen staff and probably waiters too, that me and Jepeski were lit. So what. A little buzz. I could still work.
               </p>
               <p>“I’m doing just...”
               The peyote kicked in.
               “Whaa...?”<br/>
               “Yeah, I know kid. Tough question. Just try an' keep up. We gonna need stuff ASAP.”</p>
               <p>Don’t know why - probably shouldn’t have - but I drifted over to Jepeski and told him: “The peyote kicked in.” He looked at my face, into my eyes. “Wow, dude. You’re <em>seriously</em> baked. Got any more?”
               </p>
               <p>I was seriously baked. 
               And within a few minutes all staff knew I was seriously baked. Flapping Jepeski.</p>
               <p>As one might imagine, a lot of details are gone. But some impressions of the ensuing hilarity remain: Repeated barks of "HOT!" just as Larry sent red-glowing pans crashing into the sink scalding my arms; freakish smells of burnt butter, frog legs, sauce veloute and pink detergent blasting up my nose; <em>tons</em> of charred, greasy metal needing attention "ASAP!"; senior babes snarking me behind my back; french-gibbering waiters peering into my wasted eyes, pleading for <em>le peyot&egrave;</em>.... 
               </p>
               <p> But I made it. Didn't get canned or even told not to get so baked at work. Just how the placed rolled. Afterwards going home probably made short work of another bowl with Jepeski in his jacked up Nova.</p>

               <h4>Nancy</h4>
               <p>It was a sunny late summer afternoon. Except for the lone woman seated at a table with a fine veiw of Lake Washington, the restaurant was empty. Observing her from the the opposite end of the dining room, the young server was struck by her apparent beauty. And by how much she reminded him of Nancy. For most of the previous year Nancy and he had been together, as happy as any two could hope to be.</p>
               <p>Prior to his time with Nancy, nearly all of his teen  years had been a tragedy of drugs, lying and thievery. But during those wasted years he yet managed to keep his french restaurant job, advancing from dishwasher to pantry cook. And it was there, shortly after Nancy became employed as a hostess, where they met and began a relationship. And as their intimacy solidified her wholesomeness helped to change his self-destructive ways. Hence his mind was now clear, his days fruitful, and his future bright. But since only a short time had elapsed since Nancy had been compelled to move quite far away, his thoughts were distracted, his heart heavy.</p>
               <p>Balancing a filled water goblet upon a circular tray, he approached the solitary customer. The nearer proximity revealed traits differing from Nancy, but also confirmed his first impression: she was indeed beautiful. The shoulder-length of her hair was about the same as Nancy's and cast a similar golden sheen, but was styled with shorter, more defined waves. Her eyes a purer, darker blue than the grey-blue eyes of Nancy. The contour of her face was, like Nancy's, a pleasing elongated oval, but with a touch more prominence to her cheeks and chin. And though still posessing a vibrant youthful bloom, she was clearly older than Nancy, perhaps by six or seven years, he thought.</p>
               <p>"Good afternoon," he said, placing the goblet on the table. "How are you?"</p> <p>Turning her attention from the gem-sparkling view, she looked directly at him. And after a moment's pause smiled warmly and responded:</p>
               <p>"I'm fine, thank you. How are you?"</p>                   <p>"I'm fine," he said, slightly unnerved by the undisguised affection that her steady gaze communicated. Following another brief pause and still in the magic of her warm, lovely gaze, he focused back on the job at hand:</p>
               <p>"Would you care for anything else at this time?"</p>
               <p>"No. Water will be fine until my friends arrive."</p>
               <p>The thought of her friends' arrival seeming to divert her attention from the server, she resumed looking out the window towards the lake. But as he turned to depart, she looked to him once more.</p>
               <p>"Thank you," she said. "You're very sweet."</p>

               <p>After using the contents of that jar of liquid-brined kalamata olives, artichokes, sweet peppers, or capers keep both the jar and liquid. For a quick, tasty salad, vegetable or fish dressing add to the brine 5 parts mayo to 1 part mustard of you choice (I generally prefer dijon). Cover jar tightly and shake until smooth.</p> 
               <p>Adjust to desired thickness by adding more liquid or mayo/mustard. Experiment by adding any number of ingredients such as chopped garlic, fresh or dried herbs, vinegar, parmesan, etc.</p> 
               <p>For a nice on the fly Caesar dressing start with a fairly thick brine/mustard/mayo base. Add Worcestershire, finely chopped garlic, fresh lemon juice, balsamic vinegar, fresh cracked black pepper, a bit of extra virgin olive oil, and a shake or two tabasco. Add a finely chopped anchovie too, if that's your fancy.</p>

                <p>Turning to face her he again noted the genuine warmth and affection of her gaze as she held his eyes.</p>
                <p>His equilibrium suddenly shattered, he was yet able to mumble a shy "thanks" before she returned her attention to the lake.</p>
                <p>From the moment he met Nancy and indeed throughout their relationship, her presence invariably had a mellowing effect on his spirit. This was not a result of blunted interest or want of excitement, but rather a manifestation of profound compatability. Similarly attuned to life and its vagaries they were, by extention, naturally attuned to each other. They were close in age and status, enjoyed many of the same activities and pleasantries, were alike in temprament, and physically and mentally complimentary. They were content together during idleness, play, passion or silence. With Nancy he was always at ease.</p>
                <p>It was a perfect contrast to how he now felt. And walking the length of the dining room to the waiter's station, the young server wasn't sure if he could complete the journey without toppling over. His heart raced, his limbs trembled, and his suddenly untethered mind reeled in a crazy delerium of alien intoxication. He knew nothing of this golden haired beauty, but her unabashed affection and simple compliment filled him with an intense blast of confusion and joy.</p>
                <p>Entering the wait station, young server began organizing for evening service when the head waiter arrived. Tall, charismatic, and a decade his senior, the head waiter was more than a little intimidating to the younger man, who typically was hesitant to initiate any conversation not related to the job. At this time, however, he needed to vent some of the emotion surging through his nerves. Hence overcoming his accustomed timidity, he paused briefly to compose his rambling thoughts and spoke:
                </p>
                <p>"There's uh, uh, a lady out there. Table 10. Very beautiful. Um, seems to like me."</p>
                <p>Moving to the doorless arch separating the wait station from the dining area, the head waiter peered in the direction of the lone customer. Then with an expression of amused disbelief looked back to his  associate.</p>

                <p>"You don't know who that is?" he asked.</p>
                <p>"No."</p>
                <p>"That's Nancy."</p>
                <p><em>"Nancy?</em> Well that's a...."</p>
                <p>"Nancy Wilson"</p>
                <p>"Oh. Nancy Wilson?"</p>
                <p>"Oh come on, you can't be that sheltered. You never heard Magic Man....Crazy On You....Never heard of Heart?"</p>
                <p>"<em>Ahh.</em> Well yes. Sure I have. But she, she was really nice....Said I was...."</p>
                <p>"Yeah, well she is really nice. Just who she is. I know her. Sing back up for the band sometimes."</p>
                <p>"Really?"</p>
                <p>"Yeah, really. And she really is just nice. Damn kid, what were you thinking...?"</p>
                <p>The young server looked on as the head waiter went to greet the rock star, now joined by her companions. Probably fellow band members, he thought, also noting the presence of her raven-haired rockstar sister.</p>
                <p>Completing a couple more tasks in the wait station, the young server then reluctantly returned to the table, now a scene of fashionable camaraderie, and awkwardly placed goblets of ice water and baskets of bread among the chattering group.</p>
                <p>Unable to disregard the great chasm suddenly thrust between himself and the lovely woman whose prolonged gaze, only moments before, filled him with such elation, he now endeavored to avoid eye contact. And likely aware that he must now know of her superstar ranking, she probably did as well. </p>

                 <h4>The Brothers Dumas</h4>
                 <p>Charm has many forms, many facets, many faces. Though different in essence Alexander and Frederick Dumas were both enormously charm-gifted. Raised in the south Seattle hood, neither Alex nor Fred were inclined towards the thuggish mannerisms common to the area; preferring, rather, to interact with two distinct but equally effective versions of humor, and charm.</p>
                 <p>It was an upscale BBQ joint located on a busy corner of Capitol Hill, Seattle, where Alex and Fred worked. Alex was a prep cook, Fred a dishwasher. After a few years working front house gigs, I was back in the kitchen, painting ribs and grilling steaks at the same place. Walnut-hued, medium height and brawny, Alex was baritone-chatty, friendly, open, innocent. Fred was a shade darker, taller, leaner, and with a deeper voice that, though less active than his brother's had a tone of cleverness and irony. With only a slight alteration in demeanor or expression either could have looked intimidating, even menacing. But neither seemed suited towards, or interested in, being thus - their appearances invariably projecting geniality and humor.</p> 
                 <p>The restaurant's street level cooking line was behind the bar with an open view of the dining room and the busy Uptown streets beyond. During lunch and dinner service, myself and the other line cooks communicated by phone with the prep cooks and dishwashers, who worked in a spacious preparation area, one floor below. In need of a red onion during a busy lunch one day I phoned downstairs and Alex answered.</p>
                 <p>"Dumas Diner, chef speaking," He joked.<br/>
                 "Hey Alex, can you bring up a red onion."<br/>
                 "Okay!"<br/>
                 "Need it quick, please."<br/>
                 "Alright!"</p>
                 <p>It seemed too long a delay (when one is busy it always does, right?) but Alex finally did arrive. He gave me the onion. It was yellow. </p>
                 <p>"Didn't I ask for a red onion?"<br/>
                 "Yeah, but those other ones are purple...."</p>
                 <p>Funny. And <em>charming.</em></p>
               </div>
               <div class="col dumas2">
                 <p id="center">12</p>
                 <h4>The Brothers Dumas 2</h4>
                 <p>I don't here wish to be misconstrued, for my meaning is not to insult. Alex was a wonderful, genuinely funny person. But at times, and largely due to his charming innocence, his best humor was not entirely intentional. And lest you think the brothers' names are falsified to mock, or - in the case of the last name "Dumas" - intended as a demeaning pun, you would be incorrect on both points. Their names as here written, both first and last, are genuine.</p>
                 <p>I could include other instances of Alex's charm, both witting and not, but the example written is a personal favorite, has heretofore always elicited a fair burst of mirth, and fits snugly into the small plates motif. So I'll just leave it at that.</p>
                 <p>Charming moments with Fred playing the protagonist were frequent as well. Of especial poignancy was one that occurred  the night before a Holiday dinner event at which turkey was to be served.</p>
                 <p>My good friend, and the restaurant's chef, Ed Hale (First-class <em>and</em> first-rate) and I were on the upstairs line preparing a few turkeys to be roasted the following day. Needing some bread to make stuffing, I called the prep kitchen and in his deep bass voice, Fred answered:</p>
                 <p>"Boiler room!"<br/>"Hey Fred, could you bring up a couple of baguette loaves?"<br/> "Sure. Need 'em tonight?"<br/>"That's probably best, Fred."<br/>"Ok, get my peeps right on it."</p>
                 <p>Baguettes in hand, Fred lumbered up to the line and dropped them on the counter. Then pointing to a bag of giblets next to one of the turkeys, asked:</p>         
                 <p>"Is that its balls, and shit?"<br/>"Sure is Fred,"  answered the chef.<br/>"So where's its penis?"</p>
                 <p>Skipping nary a beat chef Hale reached into the turkey and pulled out the neck.<br/>Following a few seconds silence Fred shook his head and smiled.</p>
                 <p>"Damn."</p>

                       <p id="center"><u>First-class second-rate chef tip # 2</u>
                       <p>One all-too-common  cooking mistake is rinsing pasta after cooking. Not only does rinsing make pasta soggy, it also removes much of the pasta's flavor. As an alternative, when pasta is done strain, and, if using at a later time spread on a sheet pan and work in a little salt and olive oil. When cool store in a well-covered container or plastic bag. If using immediately in a tossed pasta simply remove from water with tongs (or strain) and place directly into the pan containing the sauce. Reduce to remove excess water, toss and serve. If making a pasta where the sauce is ladled on top, such as spaghetti and meatballs, pour into a colander and work in salt and olive oil. Allow to dry for a couple of minutes before placing onto plates and topping with sauce.</p>

                       <h4>Celebrity Chef 1</h4>
                       <p>It was un upscale brewery restaurant in downtown Seattle at which the celebrity chef was recently hired. That he refused to even taste the beer struck me as odd, but was of little consequence. Of greater consequence was the deep and undisguised hatred he had for me.</p>
                       <p>I had been working at the place since before it opened, finishing the wooden dining tables, organizing the kitchen equipment, cleaning, etc. It was a beautiful place with wood-and-copper-fronted beer tanks inside a large, open dining area; and a solid-copper, half-circle-shaped bar surface. The owner was British as were the lesser-carbonated, lightly-chilled ales. Once open I worked the grill and saut&egrave; stations at night. And I was very good at my job.</p>
                       <p>My afore-mentioned friend Ed Hale was the original chef, but upon securing a position with 
                       former collegue and rising-star-chef Norman Van Akens at a new Florida restaurant, he gave his notice and left. Another very good chef named Tom was then hired, did an admirable job, and became something of a friend as well. But after just a few months he gave his notice and began interviewing for his replacement.</p>
                       <p>At some point during his interviews chef Tom told me that one interested applicant was something of Los Angeles celebrity, having been sous (assistant) chef to Wolfgang Puck at one of his (Puck's) successful ventures. I was intrigued and voiced my not insignificant support to hire him.</p>
                       <p>Soon after chosen to be the restaurant's 3rd chef, the L.A. celebrity came on to the line meet me, his most important subordinate. He was a gruff-looking dude and after a brief introduction in a correspondingly gruff voice asked:<p/>
                       <p>"So, does it get pretty hot in here?"</p>
                       <p>The kitchen being open and adjacent to the temperature controlled dining area - thus clearly not a particularly hot cooking envirnment - the question seemed odd. I told it him no, it wasn't a very hot kitchen.</p>
                       <p>"Does it get pretty stressful?"</p>
                       <p>"Sometimes, but not more than any other line cooking job," I answered, again thinking the question odd, as though he was fishing for a certain response. I noticed as well that though he was smiling and acted friendly, his manner betrayed annoyance, and his eyes were unmistakably hostile.</p>
